# Code Examples
A few examples of code I have produced over a reasonably large time span.

Merit Me was written in approximately 2010. Include is the import script which received 7 exports from the on-site MIS, parsed them, compared them against the live DB and then calculated and applied the necessary changes. This import script was able to set up students, staff, class, class memberships, form groups and all other data needed for Merit Me to work. It was non-destructive and aimed to reduce the workload of the schools' IT team as much as possible.

IMS is the Image Management System I started work on in 2018 with the aim of using OpenCV to identify faces within images and automatically catalogue those images into a MySQL DB. I had a satisfying amount of success on the project before it was superceded. I explored the potential use of AWS Lambda and EC2 instances to complete the recognition, with images being stored in S3. This project was my first use of Python where it acted as the intermediary step between OpenCV and PHP.

Archaepedia was put together in 2016 and was one of my earlier uses of Bootstrap. The map page is fairly front-end-heavy making particular use of OpenLayers.
