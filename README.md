# Code Examples
A few examples of code I have produced over a reasonably large time span.

## Merit Me
Written in approximately 2010. Include is the import script which received 7 exports from the on-site MIS, parsed them, compared them against the live DB and then calculated and applied the necessary changes. This import script was able to set up students, staff, class, class memberships, form groups and all other data needed for Merit Me to work. It was non-destructive and aimed to reduce the workload of the schools' IT team as much as possible.

## Image Management System
I started work on this in 2018 with the aim of using OpenCV to identify faces within images and automatically catalogue those images into a MySQL DB. I had a satisfying amount of success on the project before it was superceded. I explored the potential use of AWS Lambda and EC2 instances to complete the recognition, with images being stored in S3. This project was my first use of Python where it acted as the intermediary step between OpenCV and PHP.

## Archaepedia
I put this together in 2016 and it was one of my earlier uses of Bootstrap. The map page is fairly front-end-heavy making particular use of OpenLayers.

## School Home Page
An example of a simple couple of web pages I put together quickly using Bootstrap and a bit of jQuery to act as a homepage for school staff. Specific images, links and fonts have been removed for privacy but the majority is intact. I put the Wi-Fi page together very quickly as an alternative to emailing out frequently compromised passwords and am pleased with the results.
